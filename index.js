// 1. Write a JavaScript program which iterates the integers from 1 to 100. But for
// multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print
// "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
// 2. Write a JavaScript program to sum the multiples of 3 and 5 under 1000.
// 3. Write a JavaScript for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will
// check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.
// Sample Output :
// "0 is even"
// "1 is odd"
// "2 is even"
// 4. Write a JavaScript conditional statement to find the largest of five numbers in the
// given array.
// Let num = [-2, 4,-5, 6,0]
// 5. Using conditional statements, write a JavaScript program to find the largest of the
// following two numbers: 10 & 40
// 6. Write a JavaScript program to find leap years from 2000 to 2022
